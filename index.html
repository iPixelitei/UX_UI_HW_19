     <h4>DuoQ Moblie Case Study</h4>
     <p class="projectDescription"> DuoQ was made to originally help gamers achieve better synergy in their gameplays by being paired up with fellow teammates with similar styles. Through our testing we discovered a majority of players prefer to keep a private and anonymous public profile and will only open up to those they feel comfortable with. While our original plan still stands, we added options and features to help our users keep private. This has helped us understand our target audience and was a key factor to shaping our app. </p>

     <h4>AbelGamers Non Profit Case Study</h4>
